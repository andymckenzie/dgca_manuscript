## Differential Correlation Simulations

The R code in this repository will run the simulations described in the DGCA manuscript.

They can be adapted to additional tools in order to compare across methods, or adapted in various other ways.

## Differential Correlation Network Figures

The files in /megena_networks describe the data and style of the subnetworks (i.e. modules) highlighted in the DGCA manuscript. Interactive versions of them can be found here:

- Network with a gain of correlation in ER+ breast cancer samples: https://goo.gl/uuSjha

- Network with a gain of correlation in TNBC samples: https://goo.gl/t7hn1l

These were made using CyNetShare (http://idekerlab.github.io/cy-net-share/). To generate your own, visualize the resulting MEGENA network in Cytoscape, export it as a Cytoscape.js web page, then select the network and style files and upload them to http://cynetshare.ucsd.edu/#/.
