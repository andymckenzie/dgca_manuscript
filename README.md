## Differential Correlation Simulations

The R code in this repository will run the simulations described in the DGCA manuscript.

They can be adapted to additional tools in order to compare across methods, or adapted in various other ways.

## Differential Correlation Network Figures

The files in /megena_networks describe the data and style of the networks plotted in the DGCA manuscript. Interactive versions of them can be found here, made using CyNetShare (http://idekerlab.github.io/cy-net-share/).
